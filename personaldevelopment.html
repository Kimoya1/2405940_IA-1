            <h3>‚úçüèΩLesson from <em>Twelve Pillars</em></h3>
            <p>In Chapters 4-7 of <em>Twelve Pillars</em> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, several key principles stood out to me. 
            Each one offered insight on how to grow academically, personally, and professionally.</p>

            <div class="pillar">
                <h3>Time Usage</h3>
                <p>Time is one of the most value resources we can have. The book emphasizes using it wisely setting priorites, planning 
                ahead and avoiding distractions.
                I've learned to manage my time better by setting clear study schedules and deadlines. As a student and aspiring graphic designer, 
                this skill ensures that I stay balanced between my creativity and productivity.</p>

            <h3>üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My Reflection</h3>
            <p> Reading <em>Twelve Pillars</em> reminded me that personal growth doesn't just happen it's built through daily habits, efforts,
            and the right mindset. As I balance my Computer Science studies with my passion for design, I've realised that success isn't only about
            knowledge; it's also character and discipline. Each lesson time, relationships, and goals setting continues to shape how I learn, create,
            and move toward becoming the best version of myself.</p>
