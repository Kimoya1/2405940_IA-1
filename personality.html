               <p>My strongest traits are <strong>creativity</strong>, <strong>determination</strong>, and <strong>curiousity</strong>. 
                I often express myself through <strong>art & design</strong>, which makes learning more visual and engaging for me. 
                When I work on assignments, I like to make them stand out with layout, color, and presentation. My hobby of <em>digital art 
                and graphic design</em> inspires me to think differently and helps me approach school work with a better mindset.</p>

                <h2>My Hero and Inspiration</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    "Be Ambitious, Work Hard, Stay Humble"
                </blockquote>

                <p>My hero is <strong>my mother, Kimetha Francis</strong>. She is a school principal and one of the most dedicated and inspiring people I know.
                Her leadership, strength, and ability to balance multiple responsibilites have always encouraged me to do my best in school.
                She believes in me even when I doubt myself, and that motivates me to stay disciplined and focused on achieving my goals.</p>
                
                <p>A faourite moment that inspires me comes from watching her interact with students, she treats every child as a child of greatness.
                Which reminds me that learning isn't just about grades but growth and purpose.üå±‚ú®</p>

                <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
                <p>I completed the <a href="http://similarminds.com/" target="_blank">Similar Minds Personality Test</a>, specifically the 
                <strong>Attachment Style Personality Test</strong>. My results show that I lean toward an <strong>Avoidant Attachment</strong> (40%) with moderate
                levels of <strong>Disorganised Attachment</strong> (31%), while <strong>Secure</strong> and <strong>Anxious</strong> attachment styles are lower.</p>

                <div class="traits-image"> 
                    <img src="personality_test_results.png" alt="Attachment Style Results" class="personality-image">
                </div>  
                
                <p>I think the test has <strong>some validity</strong> because it highlighted patterns I've noticed in myself. I often enjoy independence and can sometimes 
                find it hard to open up right away, which fits the avoidant tendencies. However, as I've grown more confident and self aware, I've become stronger in 
                communicating and balancing my emotions. I think these tests are insightful tools for reflection, but they don't fully define who a person is since growth and 
                context constantly shape us.üòâ</p>
